# FiveM-Lua-Resource-Template
This is a basic template for making a Lua resource in FiveM. You don't need the `config.lua` However it makes the user experience a lot easier(the person installing this  resource and customizing it). 
All of the information was soursced from the cfx.re forums and docs.
